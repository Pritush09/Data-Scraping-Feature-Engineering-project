# Web Scraping and Feature Engineering Project 

## Scraping 
This part is based on web scraping of data from various different sites like about 100 of them and after scraping the content from each sites and organinsing them in proper dataframe the function used for extraction and organising the content into a file inside the mentioned directory can be found in the .py file 

## Feature Engineering
The following steps were taken to achieve a good vector representation of the content

### Cleaning using Stop Words Lists
    The Stop Words Lists (found in the folder StopWords) are used to clean the text so that Sentiment Analysis can be performed by excluding the words found in Stop Words List. 
### Creating a dictionary of Positive and Negative words
    The Master Dictionary (found in the folder MasterDictionary) is used for creating a dictionary of Positive and Negative words. We add only those words in the dictionary if they are not found in the Stop Words Lists. 
### Extracting Derived variables
    We convert the text into a list of tokens using the nltk tokenize module and use these tokens to calculate the 4 variables described below:
    Positive Score: This score is calculated by assigning the value of +1 for each word if found in the Positive Dictionary and then adding up all the values.

    Negative Score: This score is calculated by assigning the value of -1 for each word if found in the Negative Dictionary and then adding up all the values. We 
    multiply the score with -1 so that the score is a positive number.
    
    Polarity Score: This is the score that determines if a given text is positive or negative in nature. It is calculated by using the formula: 
    
    Polarity Score = (Positive Score – Negative Score)/ ((Positive Score + Negative Score) + 0.000001)
    Range is from -1 to +1
    
    Subjectivity Score: This is the score that determines if a given text is objective or subjective. It is calculated by using the formula: 
    
    Subjectivity Score = (Positive Score + Negative Score)/ ((Total Words after cleaning) + 0.000001)
    Range is from 0 to +1

### Analysis of Readability
    Analysis of Readability is calculated using the Gunning Fox index formula described below.
    Average Sentence Length = the number of words / the number of sentences
    Percentage of Complex words = the number of complex words / the number of words 
    Fog Index = 0.4 * (Average Sentence Length + Percentage of Complex words)

### Average Number of Words Per Sentence
    The formula for calculating is:
    Average Number of Words Per Sentence = the total number of words / the total number of sentences

### Complex Word Count
    Complex words are words in the text that contain more than two syllables.

### Word Count
    We count the total cleaned words present in the text by 
    removing the stop words (using stopwords class of nltk package).
    removing any punctuations like ? ! , . from the word before counting.

### Syllable Count Per Word
    We count the number of Syllables in each word of the text by counting the vowels present in each word. We also handle some exceptions like words ending with "es","ed" by not counting them as a syllable.

### Personal Pronouns
    To calculate Personal Pronouns mentioned in the text, we use regex to find the counts of the words - “I,” “we,” “my,” “ours,” and “us”. Special care is taken so that the country name US is not included in the list.

### Average Word Length
    Average Word Length is calculated by the formula:
    Sum of the total number of characters in each word/Total number of words
